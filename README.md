# lp_sg
Project template built from SG default installation project.
Main changes are in hooks as well as in env files.
The goal is to have a pipeline with a folder structure for our needs, use our own naming conventions and automate tasks such as 
naming scripts, rendering files, creating qt... Also added buttons with new actions to the SG default apps.
